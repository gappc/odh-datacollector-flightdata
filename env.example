# The start command for the Docker container that runs the datacollector. The
# default command starts the datacollector application in development mode, changes
# to the source code result in a recompile and restart of the datacollector.
# The development mode is fine for development purposes, but should not be
# used in production. If you want to start the datacollector in production your
# start command could look like this:
#
# bash -c 'mvn clean package -Dquarkus.package.type=uber-jar -D quarkus.package.output-name=datacollector -DskipTests && java -jar target/datacollector-runner.jar'
